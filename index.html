          <h1>Gojo Satoru</h1>
         
          <p>Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Clan, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.</p>
        
          
    </div>
    <div class="Ability-contack">
        <h1>Ability</h1>
        <h2 class="title">Six Eyes</h2>

        <p> <img src="25c8aa01b719f3082084e8c787f30534.jpg" alt="six-eyes" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left;">The Six Eyes (六りく眼がん Rikugan?) are an innate gift rarely inherited within the Gojo clan. They are a nonstandard jujutsu trait manifesting as a pair of bright blue eyes that grant a bearer extrasensory perception. This includes seeing the flow of cursed energy in extreme detail and the ability to use that flow to read cursed techniques. The eyes also allow for ultra-precise control over the user's cursed energy, which is indispensable for properly utilizing the Limitless technique.
Satoru Gojo is the first sorcerer to be born with both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in approximately four hundred years.</p>

<h2 class="title">Limitless</h2>
<p> <img src="jujutsu-kaisen.gif" alt="Limitless" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right;">Limitless (無む下か限げん Mukagen?) is an inherited technique passed down in the Gojo Clan. This technique brings the concept of "Infinity" into reality, allowing the user to manipulate and distort space at will.
While any member of the Gojo Family can hereditarily gain this technique, only those who also possess the Six Eyes as well can truly master the power of the Limitless.[1] Satoru Gojo is the first sorcerer to be born with both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in the last four hundred years.</p>
<h3 class="title">Blue</h3>
<p><img src="1a04739f3acc15200c86f2bf72b8492b.gif" alt="Blue" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left;">Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue (術じゅつ式しき順じゅん転てん「蒼あお」 Jutsushiki Junten・Ao?): The reinforced version of the neutral limitless;[38] Blue is the byproduct of Gojo amplifying the Limitless with negative cursed energy, producing a vacuum. Through these, Gojo creates a scenario where the world itself is forced to correct itself and fill in the negative space, causing all matter in the range of the commanded space to be pulled together.[44]</p>
<h3 class="title">Red</h3>
<p><img src="gojo-satoru-gojo (1).gif" alt="Red" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right;">Cursed Technique Reversal: Red (術じゅつ式しき反はん転てん「赫あか」 Jutsushiki Hanten・Aka?)[46]: Being an inversion of Blue, Red has the opposite effect. By flowing positive energy generated from reverse cursed technique into his Limitless technique,[47][48] Satoru inverts the properties of Blue and activates the divergence of Infinity, causing an extremely powerful repulsive force that blasts targets away. Red outputs at least twice as much as energy as Blue.[49]</p>
<h3 class="title">Purple</h3>
<p><img src="472758682_122175903368100616_4122245880370183284_n.jpg" alt="Purple" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left;">Hollow Technique: Purple (虚きょ式しき「茈むらさき」 Kyoshiki・Murasaki?): An advanced technique that collides the Lapse and Reversal of the Limitless, resulting in the creation of imaginary mass that is then launched at the target to deal destructive damage.[50]	</p>
<h3 class="title">Reverse Cursed Technique</h3>
<p><img src="tumblr_b6bb4f9b8330fe1606b8b11a2c74c5b5_c1cce4c5_540.webp" alt="Revers Cursed Technique" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right;">Reverse Cursed Technique (反はん転てん術じゅつ式しき Hanten Jutsushiki?): At first, while a first and second year student of Jujutsu High, Satoru was unable to grasp the complex nature of reverse cursed technique. After being put on his deathbed during his first fight with Toji Fushiguro, Satoru finally understood how to perform the technique and tapped into the core of cursed energy, granting him the ability to not only heal himself, but also make the positive energy flow into the Limitless, giving him access to his Red and Hollow Purple techniques.[51]
During his duel with Sukuna, Satoru survived the onslaught of slashes from Malevolent Shrine by using reverse cursed technique at full power.[52] Additionally, Satoru further demonstrated his expertise with reverse cursed technique by using it to replenish his burned-out cursed technique, an unprecedented and seemingly impossible feat even for a talented sorcerer like Yuta Okkotsu.[53]</p>
<h3 class="title">Curtain</h3>
<p><img data-aos="fade-left" src="tumblr_f2eedf08e4f7f4a88d158b792d3291e9_0b08ebf7_540.webp" alt="Curtain" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left;">Curtain (帳とばり Tobari?): Gojo can create a barrier that surrounds a certain area. The barrier can seal the area off from other people or a specific person wanting to get in.</p>
<h3 class="title">Domain Expansion</h3>
<p><img data-aos="fade-right" src="satoru-gojo-domain-expansion.gif" alt="Domain Expansion" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right;">Unlimited Void (無む量りょう空くう処しょ Muryōkūsho?): Satoru's Domain Expansion. It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and actions.[56] In terms of raw strength, Satoru's domain is equal to Sukuna's on the inside, only losing due to Malevolent Shrine's open domain that allowed Sukuna to destroy the barrier of Unlimited Void.[57] Satoru's skill with his Domain Expansion is so great that he can precisely activate it for only 0.2 seconds, limiting its lasting effect on those he traps within it,[58] and is able to freely change the conditions of Unlimited Void's barrier. Satoru himself and those he makes physical contact with are immune to its effect.[59]</p>

Geto and Gojo then get into an argument about the strong protecting the weak which almost ends with them fighting. Suddenly, Masamichi enters the room and gives Geto and Gojo a mission from Master Tengen: to escort the new Star Plasma Vessel to Tokyo Jujutsu High.[6] explains to the two about the importance of the mission and that they will need to look out for two groups, Q and the Time Vessel Association, who want to stop them. After being informed about the mission, Gojo and Geto head out.[7]</p2></div>


        <div><p3 >As they arrive at the location to pick up the Star Plasma Vessel for the mission, an explosion happens and the vessel falls to the ground from the window of her hotel room. Before the girl hits the ground, Gojo helps Geto save the vessel. Gojo is then confronted by a member of Q, Bayer.[8] Gojo easily defeats Bayer, and meets up with Geto and the vessel, Riko Amanai. Gojo, along with Geto, introduce themselves to Riko and her caretaker, Misato Kuroi. The four then start to talk, and Riko explains how she is not upset about fusing with Tengen.</p3></div>


        <div></div><p4 >After talking, Gojo and Geto are forced by Riko to escort her to her junior high so that she can visit her friends one last time. Once they arrive at the school, Gojo calls Masamichi, who explains how they have to oblige Riko before she fuses with Tengen. After talking with Masamichi, they decide to check the surveillance cursed spirits and Geto tells Gojo that two have been exorcised.[10] Gojo and Misato head out to protect Riko, while Geto deals with the intruders.</p4>

On the way, Gojo is contacted by Geto, who informs him about the situation.[12] Suddenly, the two encounter multiple identical opponents and Gojo figures out that the enemy is using his Cloning Technique to increase his numbers. Nonetheless, Gojo manages to easily defeat the man, but Riko informs him that Misato has been captured by other enemies.</p5>/div>


        <div></div><p6 ><img src="jujutsu-kaisen-movie-2025-1.webp" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right;">Gojo and Riko meet up with Geto and they discuss what to do next.

The next day, the four head back to the college but are attacked by Toji Fushiguro when they arrive, with Gojo having a sword stabbed through his chest.[14]</p6>


        <div></div><p7 ><img src="Toji_stabs_Satoru_in_the_head_29.webp" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left;">Gojo tells the others to head inside, while he takes care of the enemy. Gojo fights the man but notices that he can't read his opponent's moves, because Toji has no cursed energy. When he loses track of the enemy, Gojo decides to sweep the field with the maximum cursed energy output of his Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue. After sweeping the field, Gojo figures that his opponent won't be able to sneak up on him but Toji manages to block his vision with multiple fly heads. Satoru momentarily hesitates upon considering the possibility that Toji went after Riko, allowing the Sorcerer Killer to close in and stab him through the neck with the Inverted Spear of Heaven.[15] Toji then cuts Gojo down in a rapid flurry of slashes before finishing him off with a stab to the head, seemingly killing the jujutsu sorcerer.[</p7>
        <div></div><p8 ><img src="IMG_0188.webp" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right;">Unbeknownst to Toji, Gojo learned how to perform reverse cursed technique on the verge of death, allowing him to heal himself.

Gojo is contacted by Shoko who tells him that Geto is in Shinjuku. Gojo heads over to Shinjuku and manages to confront Geto.

Yuji asks about the casualties that come from curses, which Gojo explains it to him. Yuji then asks for Sukuna's finger, and Gojo gives the finger to him. Yuji manages to remain in control after eating the finger, which Gojo figures that Yuji is able to keep Sukuna in check.

Gojo then helps to explain how the event will be held to the students. Afterwards Gojo meets with Utahime, and Gojo reveals that there might be a spy and that he wants Utahime to investigate the Kyoto college.

As the event starts, Gojo watches it through monitors with the other faculties. During the event, Mei Mei notices how strong Maki is and wonders why she has not been promoted. Gojo explains how her family is getting in the way and also points out how the video around Yuji is inconsistent. Gojo thinks that they have something up their sleeve, but Yuji is not the same that he once was. As another curse spirit is exorcised, Gojo wonders if the students have forgotten about the main objective. When intruders invade the site, Gojo heads over to the site along with Utahime and Yoshinobu. As they head over, Yoshinobu tells Gojo to get into the area before the screen is completed, but Gojo notices that the effect of the screen is already done. As the three reach the site, they find out the Gojo is the only one that can't enter the screen. Gojo tells the two to head in so that they can help the others. After some time passes, Gojo finally manages to break into the barrier. He decides to handle Juzo first, and easily manages to restrain him. Gojo then uses a Hollow Purple technique on Hanami, but they can't tell for sure if he is killed. After the intruders have been dealt with, Gojo attends a meeting with the other faculty members were they discuss everything that had happened during the invasion and how they have got nothing from Juzo. As Masamichi says that the event is over, Gojo notes that this is not for them to decide. Gojo then meets with the students and they settle on continuing the event. When its decided that they will play a game of baseball, Gojo plays that umpire for the game.</p24>

<div></div><p25>Days later, Gojo calls Utahime to talk about what his students have done and wonders if she had found something out about the mole in the midst. After hanging up on Utahime, Gojo thinks about how he is counting on Mei Mei, who he transfers 10 million yen to, via the bank account.</p25>
<h2 class="title">Shibuya Incident Arc</h2>
<div></div><p26><img src="gojo-eyes-jjk-shibuya-xvnijth.gif" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right">Sometime later, Gojo is asleep when Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara arrive at his location. Gojo wakes up, and gets up from his seat. When Megumi asks him why was he smiling to which he says its nothing and sends them to Utahime.</p26>
<div></div><p27>On October 31, Gojo enters the curtain that was erected over Shibuya. As Gojo makes his way through the crowd of people, he figures about what the enemy's intentions and decides to move towards the basement. As Gojo reaches the underground subway, he is confronted by Jogo, Hanami, and Choso. Gojo then prepares to fight against the three. As Hanami starts to block all the exits, Gojo tells them that that is not necessary since he is not planning to run away.</p27>
<div></div><p28><img src="Satoru_Gojo_targets_weakened_Hanami_29.webp" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left">The cursed spirit then have the trapped people surround them and starts to attack Gojo. When Jogo and Hanami attack using the domain amplification technique on Gojo, but Gojo manages to dodge it. Gojo thinks about how domain amplification works and how he is now vulnerable to their attacks. When Jogo comments about how Gojo was not going to run away, while Gojo replies that he is surprised that the cursed spirits think that they thought that they could defeat him with tiny brains. Gojo takes his blindfold around his eyes off, and says that he will first take down Hanami since Hanami hasn't learned his lesson after facing him twice before.</p28>
<div></div><p29>As Gojo gets closer to Jogo and Hanami, Jogo and Hanami attack Gojo. Gojo manages to dodge their attacks and even manages to rip Jogo's arm off. As Jogo goes to distance himself from the fight, Gojo chances after him. Hanami figures that Gojo is not using his cursed techniques and decides to try and attack with his technique, but Jogo tells him not to do it. Gojo quickly grabs a hold of Hanami and breaks the branches off of Hanami's head. Suddenly Choso attacks Gojo, but Gojo easily blocks the attack. Gojo figures out that Choso is one of the Cursed Womb Death Painting and how he is not attacking like Hanami and Jogo. Suddenly Hanami and Jogo attack Gojo, but Gojo tells them that this attack won't work since Hanami is currently weakened. Gojo then uses his cursed technique to crush Hanami against the wall. After killing Hanami, Gojo tells Jogo that he is next.</p29>
<div></div><p30><img src="Jogo_running_from_Satoru_Gojo_29.webp" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right">Jogo and Choso continue to attack Gojo, but all their attacks don't work. Gojo thinks about how the two are attacking from a distance and that is all they can do. Gojo notices that the people are starting to avoid him and thinks about how he will be able to get to Jogo once enough people scatter. Gojo thinks about how he wants to fight the two and that he won't be able to save them all. Gojo then comments about how he will exorcise the cursed spirits. When a train full of mutated humans arrive and starts to attack the people, Gojo wonders what they are thinking.
As Mahito attacks Gojo, Gojo easily dodges and counters but Mahito dodges. When more humans are sent to their location, Gojo thinks about how the entrance to their location is open and that their are more shamans or curses throwing the humans to their location. Gojo is then distracted when Mahito and Choso attack but all it does is kill the humans around him. When Jogo suddenly attacks, Gojo grabs a hold of Jogo's arm but Jogo cuts it off to get away. Gojo then activates his domain expansion for less then a second, which stuns cursed spirits and humans. After undoing his domain expansion, Gojo begins to kill all the mutated humans. After taking care of all the mutated humans, Gojo notices a small box, on the floor. The box opens, appearing what looks like a stretched piece of skin with an eye the size of a face staring back at Gojo.</p30>
<div></div><p31><img src="kenjaku-gojo.gif" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: left">Gojo stares at the eye before deciding to leave but freezes when he hears a familiar voice. Walking up from behind him was his once deceased best friend, Geto Suguru. Gojo's confusion about Geto's apparent revival causes one minute of time to pass within his mind as he flashes back on all of his memories with him. This causes the box's sealing condition to be fulfilled and wraps itself around Gojo. He realizes that this is checkmate since he is unable to move and his cursed energy is seemingly nullified. Gojo asks who the person in front of him is, the person says that he is Geto. Gojo says that even through his six-eyes ability is telling him that the person in front of him is Geto, but his soul knows that the person in front of him is not Geto. The imposter in front of him reveals that Gojo is correct and that he is capable of switching bodies by switching brains and therefore is able to covet said body's cursed technique. The person also says that he will unseal Gojo in a thousand years after they have finished their plan.</p31>
<div></div><p32><img src="gojo-geto-suguru.gif" alt="story" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0; width:200px; float: right">Gojo warns the imposter that even though he will be trapped he should still be worried about Yuta Okkotsu; the imposter explains how Yuta had become so powerful and that he won't be able to become the next Gojo. The imposter then bids Gojo farewell as he prepares to seal Gojo within the Prison Realm. Before being sealed, Gojo asks Geto how long he plans to let someone else take control of his body, when Geto's arm suddenly grabs his own neck. The imposter laughs and comments on how that this was the first time an inhabited body disobeyed him. The grip is not tight, and the impostor calls Mahito over and the two continue a philosophical discussion on what came first, the body or soul. After listening to the two ramble, Gojo tells the impostor to just seal him away already, since he is tired of listening to them. The impostor then seals Gojo in the Prison Gate's boundary.
Geto is holding the cube when it begins to shake and then plummets to the ground by an unforeseen force, shattering the floor on impact. Due to Gojo's massive amount of power, the Prison Realm is having a hard time processing his power and Gojo was able to use his technique to force the Prison Gate's Boundary to the ground much to the annoyance of the impostor. Inside of the seal, Gojo comments about how he had messed up but reassures himself that everything will be fine and that he still has faith in everyone.</p32>
